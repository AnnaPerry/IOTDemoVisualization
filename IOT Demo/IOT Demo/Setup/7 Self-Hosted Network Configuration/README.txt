Note: both scripts need to be run as an Administrator!  The first script will set up the gateway to broadcast its own self-hosted network, called gatewaynetwork (with password osisoftiot), that other devices can connect to, allowing them to access the web application (via the IP address of the gateway) without having to join the gateway and a mobile device to the same external network.  The second script will actually start this self-hosted network.

Note: the gateway will be assigned a new IP address on its own self-hosted network; therefore, after running script # 2, to start the network, while still on the gateway, from a command prompt run "ipconfig" to take note of the gateway's new IP address within its self-hosted network.  This is the IP address that will have to be used by mobile devices that are connected to the hosted network and that are trying to access the gateway's web app.  For example, if the new gateway's IP address is 192.168.137.1, then mobile devices that are connected to the hosted network need to now access the gateway web app at URL

https://192.168.137.1

Finally, in order to allow this hosted network to start automatically, a Windows Scheduled task can be set up, using Task Scheduler (use the included shortcut) to run the second .bat file after the machine boots up, which will launch the hosted network shortly after the gateway starts up.
